# 🚗 Vehicle Management System — OOP & Async in C#

A well-structured C# application showcasing real-life **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) with **Generics**, and modern **asynchronous task handling** using `async/await`.

This project is split into two independent modules to demonstrate different concepts in clean, maintainable code.

## 📦 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ OOPGeneric
> A generic vehicle management system using type-safe templates.

- Uses generic classes for different types of vehicles (e.g., `Car<T>`, `MotorCycle<T>`)
- Handles properties like model, capacity, type, and design features
- Demonstrates abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

### 2 Covers **7 different techniques** to implement asynchronous operations:
  - `Task.Factory.StartNew()`
  - `Task` with `Action`, Delegate, Lambda
  - `Task.Run()` with `await`
  - `Task.FromResult()`
- Includes user input and basic async math operations
